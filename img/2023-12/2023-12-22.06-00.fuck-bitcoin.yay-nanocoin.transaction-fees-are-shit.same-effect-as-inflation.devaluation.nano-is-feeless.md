Bitcoin? Nanocoin!

Bitcoin and most other cryptocurrencies
are shit
because they charge transaction fees
which have the same effect
as inflation on paper money:
Continuous devaluation.
of the currency.

NANO
(I call it Nanocoin)
is a rare exception
because it has zero transaction fees.

All Electronics and Information Technology
have no future,
but in the near future
I will use Nanocoin.
