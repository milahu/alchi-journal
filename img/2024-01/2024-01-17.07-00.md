# Hate Gatekeepers

because they judge others
only by their intentions
and not by their results.

# Hate Psychowar

because it always
only compares
Hypothesis versus Hypothesis
but there are
"No experiments!"
to confirm the Mysticism
(Anti-Gnosticism) of
"We will never know"
aka Ignorance:
"We dont want to know."

Psychowar is legal serial murder
against Ideas, Hypotheses,
Opinions, Feelings, Intuitions.  
trying to prevent the spreading
of "bad" ideas.
