tarballs and Zips of Git repos
Should contain the Commit object
so the content can be verified
by the commit hash (git is a CAS)
Simplest solution:
store the commit object
in .git/objects/

This means:
Tools will have to fix their
"is this a git repo?" check
because only the
presence of a .git/ folder
does not make a git repo

or better:
Include enough infos
in the
.git/ folder
to allow
reconstruction
of the full .git/ folder
-- No.
