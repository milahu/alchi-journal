# Download Managers

should be file-centric
like File Managers
to allow organizing
the downloaded files
in a filesystem tree
of folders and files.

so the download manager
tolerates moving of files
(temporary
or complete files)
also with external tools
like the "mv" command.

----

Email Clients
should not add a full quote
of the previous mail by default
to dramatically reduce
the size of all emails.
