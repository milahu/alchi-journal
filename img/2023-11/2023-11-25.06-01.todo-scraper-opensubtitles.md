Scraper Opensubtitles.org

Capture traffic live with HTTP Proxy

P2P scraper:
Can we verify content via HTTPS?

Repack by movie name
(keyed by IMDB ld)
and year
with PPMd compression
(2x smaller than zip)

TODO test more compressors
with small size
and fast decompression

subs with n–æ movie name
go to a separate DB
for example subs for Youtube videos
or movies with no IMDB entry

TV Series:
Group by episode or
Group by season?
(what gives better compression?)
