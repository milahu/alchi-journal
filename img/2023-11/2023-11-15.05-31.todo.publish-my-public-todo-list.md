My Personal TODO List

My Personality dictates:
"Start everything
finish nothing"

I have started many projects
but finished only some.

If I had more friends
then I would delegate these projects

TODO qmake to cmake Translator
Started, not finished.
Qmake can express
dependencies
between install targets
Cmake can not
â†’ Implement Toposort in cmake
TODO qmake To Meson Translator
Meson is newer/better than cmake
